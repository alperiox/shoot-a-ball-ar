# Initial demo for the AR project

A simple initial demo for the AR project of mine that lets you throw a ball using your hand.

- `R`: Reposition the ball
- `D`: Debug mode (visualize the force vector, interaction circle and hand landmarks)
- `Q`: Close the application.

TODOs:

- [ ] OOP implementation for the game,
  - Currently, there are lots of monkey patches in the source code since I wrote everything in an hour or two.
- [ ] The actual game?
